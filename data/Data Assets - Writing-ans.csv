33,D,4,Enhanced Writing Quality,,"Choice A is best. Staple indicates that the watch is something that can be integrated into everyday life seamlessly, which is the intention here.

It’s NOT Choice B because the smartwatch is the subject and is singular, so it cannot be referred to by “staples”, which is plural.

37,A,3,Subject-Verb Agreement,Parallel Structure,"Choice C is best. The overall tone of the paragraph is more negative and pensive about the future of the transition for the music industry. Choice C accurately depicts the result of the plummeting sales peak: aspiring musicians are becoming less and less optimistic about the financial future of this industry.

It’s NOT Choice D because this is grammatically incorrect and needlessly long"
40,D,4,Phrases,Clauses and Independence,"Choice B is best. Proliferation is the subject here and it is a collective singular noun. We are looking for a singular past verb tense here to have subject-verb agreement, and “has bolstered” meets that criteria. 

It’s NOT Choice A because proliferation is singular and “have bolstered” is plural tense.
