Choice B is correct. Start by translating directly:
</br>
"The width of the patio is 4 meters longer than its length"
</br>
is equivalent to the following:
<br>
$$w (\text{or any favorite variable}) =  4 + x.$$

Adding up all the sides (2 lengths and 2 widths) to find the perimeter would then be \(2(4+x)+2x=8+2x+2x=8+4x\), or B.
