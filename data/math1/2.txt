Choice A is correct. We simply need to write a line equation in the form \( y = mx + b \), where mis the slope (\( \frac{rise}{run}) \) and \(b\) is the y-intercept. As the line depicted goes through the origin, \(b=0\). Counting up three units and one unit to the right yields the resulting highlighted points \(—(1,3)\) and \((2,6)\), respectively — so \(rise = 3\) and \(run = 1\), which means the slope is just \(\frac{3}{1}=3\). Thus, the equation of this line is \(y=3x\), or to substitute in the axes labels, \(k=3m\).
