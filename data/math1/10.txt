Choice C is correct. If we define xas the number of containers that hold 4 balls and yas the number of containers that hold 6 balls, we can create a system of equations: \(x+y=30\) and \(4x+6y=168\).
 Since we want to solve for \(x\), we can rearrange the first equation to define \(y\) in terms of \(x\): \(y=30-x\).
 Then, substitute this into the second equation:
</br>
Substitute \(30-x\) in for \(y\): \(4x+6(30-x)=168\)
</br>
Multiply out the parentheses: \(4x+180-6x=168\)
</br>
Combine like terms & isolate \(x\): \(−2x=−12x=12\), which is C.
