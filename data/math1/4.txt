Choice C is correct. We know that supplementary angles must add up to \(180°\), so \(∠QLT =180°-100°=80°\). As angles in a triangle must also add up to \(180°\), and vertical angles (angles across from one another) must be equal, the two vertical angles in the center each measure \(180°-80°-40°=60°\). Lastly, if the sides \(LS\) and \(LT\) are congruent, triangle \(LST\) must be an isosceles triangle, which means \(∠S=∠T.∠T=180°-100°2=40°\), so \(r=180°-60°-40°=80°\), which is C.
