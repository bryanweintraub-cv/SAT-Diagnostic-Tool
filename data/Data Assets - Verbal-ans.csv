1,C,5,Literature,,"Choice B is best. Tabitha requests that the headmistress allow her to sit for examinations and apply for the scholarship in lines 50-65 (“My name… your opinion”). Miss Polk later advocates for Tabatha by pushing Headmistress Ratherford to read Tabatha’s letter in lines 96-97 (“At least… letter”).
 
It’s NOT Choice A because lines 39-43 make it clear that Miss Polk and the girl immediately recognize each other, while the headmistress doesn’t know the girl.
It’s NOT Choice C because this is not the main point of the passage, nor is it actually certain at what time in the day the scene is set.
It’s NOT Choice D because we have no idea if Tabitha was accepted to the school or not."
2,D,3,Literature,Supporting Evidence,"Choice B is best. The main event of the passage is clearly Tabitha’s request to be allowed to apply for the scholarship, and everything revolves around describing this event. Even after Tabitha leaves the focus of the scene is still on her and her request.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because Tabitha’s request is not a historical event, nor is her request analyzed by the characters or a narrator in any way.
It’s NOT Choice C because Tabitha’s request is actually firm and surprisingly direct, and there certainly is no definitive response.
It’s NOT Choice D because the tone is not somber, and neither is the passage relating any sort of tragedy."
3,D,5,Literature,Words in Context,"Choice C is best. Even if you are unfamiliar with the use of “elements” as synonymous with bad weather, in lines 3-7 the descriptions of dirty dress, tangled hair, and hurrying from work should lead you to presume “inclement weather” is the answer (tangled hair could be caused by wind, for example).
 
It’s NOT Choice A because components doesn’t explain Tabitha’s dirty dress and tangled hair.
It’s NOT Choice B because oxygen and nitrogen doesn’t explain Tabitha’s dirty dress and tangled hair, and is moreover oddly and unnecessarily specific.
It’s NOT Choice D because basic information doesn’t explain Tabitha’s dirty dress and tangled hair."
4,C,3,Literature,,"Choice A is best. Lines 7-8 (“She was… at all”) imply that Tabitha is prepared for a difficult interview – her fear is that she will not be granted one at all.
 
It’s NOT Choice B because Tabitha just wants a chance to take the examinations any way that she can.
It’s NOT Choice C because Tabitha actually expects some sort of rebuke and is prepared for a “cold reception”.
It’s NOT Choice D because Tabitha does not have any qualifications and knows that the headmistress will be skeptical of the arguments that Tabitha makes."
5,A,3,Literature,,"Choice A is best. See explanation for Question 4.
 
It’s NOT Choice B because the headmistress’s actions reveal no insight as to what Tabitha’s fears are.
It’s NOT Choice C because while Tabitha is startled to see Miss Polk, this offers no support as to her fear that the headmistress will refuse to grant her an interview at all.
It’s NOT Choice D because while the headmistress seems disinclined to allow Tabitha to apply for the scholarship, this does not give us any evidence that Tabitha had been afraid of this very possibility."
6,A,2,Literature,Supporting Evidence,"Choice D is best. “Deferential” means respectful in a submissive way. While Tabitha demonstrates her respect for the headmistress’s authority, line 51 describes her voice as “stronger than anyone had expected”. Thus, Tabitha also displays a confidence in herself.
 
It’s NOT Choice A Tabitha is never described as quiet or timid. If anything, she is bold and surprisingly assertive.
It’s NOT Choice B because Tabitha does seem to be genuinely in need of this scholarship – she has traveled all the way from work in inclement weather just for an opportunity to sit for the examinations.
It’s NOT Choice C because there is no sense that Tabitha is overly submissive or ingratiating."
7,B,5,Literature,Fact Recall,"Choice D is best. The paragraph introduces Miss Polk and Headmistress Rutherford, demonstrating their respective personalities and the power dynamic between the two women.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because the paragraph focuses on the two characters. In fact, we don’t actually know what the exact location of the setting is, and no aspects of the “place” are described.
It’s NOT Choice B because there is no argument that is presented, only description.
It’s NOT Choice C because while Miss Polk is vaguely critical of the socioeconomic class of students that sit for examinations, this is not an indictment of the school as a whole. The criticism is merely limited to luxurious hats of the girls of supposedly meager means."
8,D,3,Literature,,"Choice A is best. The headmistress is able to infer Miss Polk’s meaning through her indirect explanation; thus, Miss Polk’s explanation and intent are obvious.
 
It’s NOT Choice B because Miss Polk’s argument is not unrelenting. In fact, Miss Polk is not even confident enough to come out directly in support of Tabitha.
It’s NOT Choice C because opaque is actually an antonym of clear.
It’s NOT Choice D because simple doesn’t fully capture the idea that Miss Polk had made her desire for Tabitha to be considered fully evident to Headmistress Ratherford."
9,D,3,Literature,Words in Context,"Choice C is best. Lines 41-43 (“The girl… Miss Polk”) make evident that the headmistress has taken note of Tabitha’s reaction to Miss Polk and her apparent recognition of her.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because we simply don’t have the evidence to know if this is true or not. Tabitha could have conceivably learned about the examination through many other channels left unmentioned in the passage.
It’s NOT Choice B because Miss Polk’s lack of reaction to Tabitha would not be enough for the headmistress to figure out that Miss Polk knows Tabitha.
It’s NOT Choice D because the headmistress cannot be confident that Miss Polk knows every girl applying for or interested in the scholarship examinations."
10,A,2,Literature,Words in Context,"Choice C is best. See explanation for Question 9.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because at this point in the passage Tabitha has not even been introduced yet.
It’s NOT Choice B because Miss Polk’s impassivity can’t give Headmistress Ratherford any idea that she knows Tabitha.
It’s NOT Choice D because nothing in Tabitha’s self-introduction implies that she and Miss Polk have any prior connection."
11,C,5,Social Science,Fact Recall,"Choice A is best. The first paragraph begins by describing the countless hours spent by Americans in choosing their insurance. Consumers are the focus of this introductory paragraph: lines 4-10 (“Billions of… body parts”)are merely a continuation of this idea and an attempt to show that consumer desire to purchase insurance is greater than ever.
 
It’s NOT Choice B because while lines 5-10 do give an example of different items that can be insured, this is not the main point of the passage.
It’s NOT Choice C because line 13 directly contradicts this point, arguing that “consumers typically feel secure”.
It’s NOT Choice D because this paragraph is about consumer and customer demand, not insurance supply."
12,D,3,Social Science,Fact Recall,"Choice B is best. Reading the full sentence from lines 8-12 (“Insurance is… emotions”), the word “despite” implies that there are emotions that run contrary to the rising popularity of insurance itself. Thus, we expect the answer to imply some sense of opposition, and specifically a contrast between willingness and unwillingness.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because these emotions are not necessarily jarring, even if the contrasting emotions may be somewhat uncomfortable.
It’s NOT Choice C because uncertain is not an appropriate synonym for discordant.
It’s NOT Choice D because while cacophonous is synonymous to discordant, this is regards to the auditory definition of discordant, which is the incorrect one to apply here."
13,A,4,Social Science,Words in Context,"Choice D is best. Lines 45-48 (“According to… reduce risk”) argue that “people are willing to forfeit money in order to reduce risk”. Thus, people use insurance and value it as a means to avoid risk.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because there is no evidence for this point, and the passage actually argues in lines 72-75 that the financial penalties of the insurance itself are higher, while line 32 argues that single time financial penalties are typically in the range of $5000.
It’s NOT Choice B because this answer choice is too specifically tailored to automobile accidents. Why would fears on driving create value for insurance pets or a mortgage, for example?
It’s NOT Choice C because not all insurance is required by the government, and lines 71-75 directly contradict this argument anyways."
14,B,4,Social Science,,"Choice C is best. This paragraph provides an explanation for why insurance has value, using risk aversion theory to support its claim.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because lines 12-18 only create confusion as to why insurance would be valued.
It’s NOT Choice B because a government mandate does not explain why people want insurance, while it may help to explain why people actually purchase insurance.
It’s NOT Choice D because this directly contradicts the logic behind purchasing insurance."
15,A,3,Social Science,Supporting Evidence,"Choice C is best. The author of the passage introduces this new study as a mechanism through which he can introduce the idea of risk theory, an idea that has not yet been developed anywhere before in the passage.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because the passage introduces this new study in order to produce more evidence for the same point.
It’s NOT Choice B because while the first sentence of the passage questioned the motive or logic behind the valuing of insurance, the rest of the passage is an attempt to explain and answer this question.
It’s NOT Choice D because while this study does study the idea of risk aversion theory, its main purpose is to introduce the idea of risk aversion to the reader and thus plays a more important role in introducing a new idea than supporting an old theory."
16,C,3,Social Science,,"Choice A is best. The neuropsychologists have found supporting evidence for risk aversion theory described in lines 39-51 (“In a recent… process”), and therefore would be likely to find it reasonable.
 
It’s NOT Choice B because if the neuropsychologists found strong evidence for the theory, they would be more likely to accept than question the theory.
It’s NOT Choice C because just because they agree with the theory does not mean that they find it predictable. Furthermore, it is somewhat nonsensical to describe a theory as “predictable”.
It’s NOT Choice D because the neuropsychologists would feel exactly the opposite way of this answer choice."
17,C,3,Social Science,Supporting Evidence,"Choice D is best. Car companies are using commercials to try and convince (“sway”) customers to purchase insurance as described in lines 52-55 (“Car insurance… actually are”). The key here is that they are trying to “make them believe” certain things. Of the answer choices, persuade is the word that lines up most with these constraints.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because wobbling a customer into buying insurance makes no sense.
It’s NOT Choice B because while this choice is appealing, it does not convey enough of the convincing aspect that is necessary and implied in “sway” and emotional appeals. Additionally, I could convince you to buy insurance if a large part of you did not want to, but to convert you implies that there is no reluctance on your part to buy insurance, which is too strong a claim here.
It’s NOT Choice C because this answer choice is again a synonym on the physical definition of “sway” and makes no sense in this context."
18,A,3,Social Science,Words in Context,"Choice B is best. The answer lies in the second half of the same sentence. That “this fear is at odds with the daily experience of most car insurance subscribers” heavily implies that this assumption is incorrect, or an unsupported fear. Misguided best fits this description.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because this is directly contradictory to the second half of the noted sentence.
It’s NOT Choice C because contradictory is too strong a word. While the evidence doesn’t quite back up the belief fully, it is still true that since deadly crashes are still possible the reality is not directly contradictory to the underlying belief.
It’s NOT Choice D because the second half of the given sentence implies that the assumption is not undetermined, but actually incorrect."
19,B,5,Social Science,Data Analysis,"Choice B is best. See answer for Question 18.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because this is an emotional appeal used by car insurance companies that, if anything, supports the assumption stated in lines 62-63.
It’s NOT Choice C because lines 75-78 describe how insurance companies can exploit the assumption made in 62-63, but provides no explanation for why the assumption is misguided.
It’s NOT Choice D because while part of it argues that purchasing insurance may be irrational, it gives no evidence for why it is irrational, nor does it provide any explanation relevant to fears of getting into deadly automobile accidents."
20,A,2,Social Science,Data Analysis,"Choice B is best. The graph shows that Benefit without Crash is the least relevant category on insurance purchasing decisions/profit.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because annual cost of insurance is greater than benefit without cost.
It’s NOT Choice C because annual benefit received is greater than benefit without cost.
It’s NOT Choice D because benefit with crash is greater than benefit without cost."
21,D,3,Social Science,Data Analysis,"Choice C is best. This has been the idea of the entire passage, and is supported by the graph showing the willingness of the population to purchase insurance far in excess of the amount that will be paid out. This concept is best illustrated in lines 37-51 (“Why do… process”).
 
It’s NOT Choice A because a government mandate would be unable to explain the differences in costs and payments shown in the graph.
It’s NOT Choice B because a growing acceptance of insurance would be unable to explain the differences in costs and payments shown in the graph.
It’s NOT Choice D because a lack of wealth in America if anything would imply that insurance purchases should be falling, but does not explain the disparity in costs and payments of insurance."
22,A,4,Science,,"Choice B is best. The use of “building blocks” emphasizes the importance of neurons in the brain and implies that they are of foundational importance for the rest of the brain and nevous system.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because there is no evidence to argue that all neurons are a permanent part of the brain.  
It’s NOT Choice C because the author gives no sense that neurons are stacked on top of each other.
It’s NOT Choice D because line 10 argues that neurons are complex structures, and the entire rest of the passage is spent focusing on and describing the organization of neurons."
23,C,3,Science,Author-Based Questions,"Choice A is best. Lines 24-26 directly contradict the stated claim, arguing that “Unlike other parts of the neuron, the soma does not play a role in the transmitting information”.
 
It’s NOT Choice B because the axon transmits the neural signal, which is still information.
It’s NOT Choice C because the terminal button and synapse both receive and send to other neurons.
It’s NOT Choice D because lines 64-67 have no information on what roles individual parts of the neuron have in transmitting information."
24,C,2,Science,Words in Context,"Choice D is best. Lines 13-15 provide a clear analog to trees, where the author describes dendrites as stretching out like branches.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because long and complex is not obviously a comparison to a tree.
It’s NOT Choice B because there is no evidence for this.
It’s NOT Choice C because smaller neurons are never actually explicitly mentioned. The author mentions that some neurons have only one dendrite, but this is irrelevant for our question."
25,B,4,Science,Fact Recall,"Choice C is best. The author includes paragraph 3, lines 23-39 (“The next… running”), in order to describe a part of the neuron that is vital to the cell’s continued operation despite not playing a direct role in information transmission.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because the author never makes a direct comparison between neurons and other cells, and does not appear to find it important to draw a distinction at any point in the passage.
It’s NOT Choice B because the author makes no effort to rank any part of the neuron in order of importance, nor does the description of the soma have any information to distinguish between the importance of the role of the dendrites against the axons.
It’s NOT Choice D because the author actually explicitly states that the soma has no role in information transmission."
26,C,3,Science,Supporting Evidence,"Choice B is best. The author uses an appositive phrase to describe myelinated axoms as having a fatty layer. If all axons had a fatty later, this description would be redundant and completely unnecessary. Thus, we can fairly imply that not all axons have a fatty later and that myelinated axons are unique in this regarded.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because the author encodes no sort of information on the size of myelinated axons in lines 52-54.
It’s NOT Choice C because while myelinated axons seem to fulfill their functions well in large part due to their fatty layer, it is not at all clear that a fatty layer would consequently aid in the execution of the tasks of other types of neurons.
It’s NOT Choice D because lines 52-54 make no statement about axons in general, and do not even lead correctly to the conclusion that myelinated axons would not function without their fatty layer. Perhaps they still could operate but only at a restricted pace."
27,A,5,Science,,"Choice D is best. The word opposite is applied, well, in opposition to the idea that “it may seem as though the information transmission process takes a long time”. Thus, the author is attempting to fight against this idea. Coupled with the terms “lightning” and “instantaneously” we see that the final paragraph must function in emphasizing some aspect of speed or quickness of neuron ability. Choice D fits this description perfectly.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because while the author believes this, this is not the main purpose of the final passage and the “lightning” and “instantaneously” do not support this idea strongly.
It’s NOT Choice B because nowhere in the passage is this claim made or mentioned.
It’s NOT Choice C because while this claim may be true, the author is attempting to make a stronger argument than this, in particularly how effectively neurons function."
28,B,4,Science,Supporting Evidence,"Choice D is best. Please be careful in looking at the graph. Note that figures in the cerebral cortex column are given in billions. Thus, the correct answer is .245*1,000,000,000 = 245,000,000 and 8.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because .245 is incorrect.
It’s NOT Choice B because 179 is incorrect.
It’s NOT Choice C because 80 is incorrect."
29,D,4,Science,Fact Recall,"Choice C is best. The author argues that humans are the most advanced species in part because of our large cerebral cortex neuron count in lines 7-9 (Humans are… neurons), yet we do not have the most neurons even of the animals given in the table. This would suggest that there is more to intelligence than raw cerebral cortex neuron count.
 
It’s NOT Choice A, although this is a reasonable guess. While this does seem to line up in part with the author’s argument that large numbers of neurons help explain why humans are so advanced, if neurons are important we would expect whales to at least have a reasonable expectation of being more intelligent than humans.
It’s NOT Choice B because by this logic, this answer should be wrong because humans have less neurons than a pilot whale.
It’s NOT Choice D because the passage doesn’t make any mention of the importance of heavy brains on intelligence."
30,D,2,Science,Author-Based Questions,"Choice C is best. 37.2 billion is the number of neurons in the pilot whale, which is the only animal to show a greater of neurons than humans.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because this refers to the number of neurons in a chimpanzee.
 It’s NOT Choice B because this refers to the number of neurons in an African elephant.
It’s NOT Choice D because this refers to the weight of the brain of a pilot whale, but does not refer to the number of neurons it has."
31,D,2,Science,Words in Context,"Choice C is best. A quick look at random animals in the table will reveal that number of cerebral cortex neurons and brain weight are not directly related – the relationship certainly varies. For example, consider the hedgehog, the dog, and the marmoset. Lines 7-9 (“Humans are… of neurons”) describe how humans have a very high number of cerebral cortex neurons, despite our intermediate brain mass.
 
It’s NOT Choice A because the table shows that neurons and weight are not directly related.
It’s NOT Choice B because the table shows that neurons and weight are not directly related.
It’s NOT Choice D because lines 67-70, while explaining the speed of neurons and their execution, offer no insight or relevance to the varying relation between neurons and brain weight."
32,D,4,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice B is best. Hardship is a consistent theme in the narrator’s story, starting in paragraph one with “only in our dreams and on our deathbeds can we fantasize about a different life.” In lines 26-35 (“In another… illiterate parents”) the detailed descriptions of everything the narrator can’t do that we often take for granted, including having a source of food and water, paint a dark picture of life in this rural village. 

It’s NOT Choice A because the passage never mentions traditions, and there is little in this village that the narrator deems to be valuable. 
It’s NOT Choice C because the passage never mentions any specific plans for reform; it is more a wistful examination of an unjust world. 
It’s NOT Choice D because while the narrator briefly discusses the possibility of changing her fate, she immediately rules it out as impossible."
33,B,3,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice D is best. The key to this question lies in lines 32-36 (“I didn’t… we are”), starting with the cycle of “I didn’t ask…” The narrator laments that she never had a chance at a better life simply because of the conditions which she was born under. Although she can dream at what could have been, ultimately “Life is a lottery, and I have never been lucky.”

It’s NOT Choice A because the narrator repeatedly states that her condition will never improve.
It’s NOT Choice B because although the narrator does use the example of a university education as a good thing in life she will never achieve, it is just a small part of her grievances. 
It’s NOT Choice C because the narrator asserts that dreams are her only means to see a better life at the end of paragraphs one and three."
34,A,3,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice A is best. The author’s choice to write this passage in first person makes it intensely personal. Through the use of the word “I,” we can directly observe her thoughts, hopes, dreams, and doubts unclouded by a third person narrator or other point of view. 

It’s NOT Choice B because the author could have said she was hopeful without using the first person “I,” and it is clear she is ultimately not hopeful about her lot.
It’s NOT Choice C because this is not a suspenseful passage, but even if the author wanted to do so, she would not have needed to use the first person.
It’s NOT Choice D because the narrator does not advocate for personal happiness, but rather laments her uninspiring future."
35,D,4,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice B is best. The author clearly wishes she could have a life like that outlined in lines 11-25 (“I imagine… for support”). This is further backed up by the statements “in another life, I could be like them, floating like stars in the sky,” and then “if only the world were fair and every child could have the same opportunities,” wistfully referring to herself. 

It’s NOT Choice A because the narrator talks about other people’s lives in positive terms, as something she wishes every child had the opportunity for. 
It’s NOT Choice C because the narrator seems clear about what she wants, at least in general terms: the opportunity to make something of her life. 
It’s NOT Choice D because the passage is heavily focused on her life and what is impossible for her, so she uses examples of what other people her age are doing to comment on her own difficult life. "
36,B,4,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice B is best. The belief that her life will remain the same despite her dreams is outlined in lines 5-10 (“This is… different life.”), where the author is setting up the rest of the passage.

It’s NOT Choice A because the narrator specifically says that a better future is not possible for her. 
It’s NOT Choice C because the narrator never talks about thing getting worse, just that they will stay the same. 
It’s NOT Choice D because college is outside of the realm of possibilities for her--she will never go to college, nevermind graduating from it. "
37,D,3,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice D is best. This is the only quote from the passage that makes it explicitly clear that her life has no potential for improvement. The other answer choices do show different aspects of her despair, but none of them capture the full picture quite like “I am sure that future will not come.” 

It’s NOT Choice A because saying the place where she was born will be the same place she dies does not mean that her life cannot improve; in fact, many people die in their hometowns after successful lives. 
It’s NOT Choice B because this quote only talks about her inability to go to college and leaves open the possibility her life could improve in other ways. 
It’s NOT Choice C because a lack of food or access to quality education is not necessarily a perfect indicator of her hopelessness in life."
38,D,4,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice A is best. Wistful means to have a feeling of vague or regretful longing, and resigned means to have accepted something one cannot do anything about. This characterizes the passage as a whole, but especially in these questions. She wishes she could be like the other students, but realizes that is outside the realm of possibility for her. 

It’s NOT Choice B because even though she may be jealous, she is certainly not ecstatic, which means to be filled with overwhelming joy. 
It’s NOT Choice C because empathetic means to understand the emotions of others. While she wishes she has a different life, these questions are not about sharing the other students’ feelings. 
It’s NOT Choice D because provocative and needling both mean to deliberately make someone else annoyed or angry, which is no the case here."
39,C,3,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice C is best. Here the best evidence comes directly after the quoted part in question 38. These lines reaffirm her central claim that although she wishes she had a better life, there is nothing that can be done about it. This is particularly clear in the line “then again, none of us asked to be who we are.” 

It’s NOT Choice A because this quote does not relate at all to her questions--the quote is in paragraph one, and the questions are in paragraph three. While the general sentiment is similar, it is too far away to be the best explanation for question 38. 
It’s NOT Choice B because this quote exemplifies here wistfulness, because it has the feeling of an idle daydream, but not her resignation.
It’s NOT Choice D because while this is a fitting close for this passage, it does not relate directly to the questions from question 38. "
40,A,4,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice C is best. Open or closed doors is a common metaphor for opportunities in English, and it specifically relates to the narrator’s overall theme. While she still has her dreams as a mean of escape, she knows that she has no opportunity to actually improve her lot in life. 

It’s NOT Choice A because the narrator specifically states that dreams are still possible for her. 
It’s NOT Choice B because misfortune is not “closed” for her; it is a part of her existence. 
It’s NOT Choice D because charity never comes up in this passage. "
41,B,4,Historical,Dual Passage,"Choice A is best. This hits again on the main theme of the passage, which is that she has no opportunity for a better life simply because of where she was born. Specifically, this quote shows that despite her vivid dreams of improving her life, she knows ultimately nothing will change, and so she returns to her daily routines because she has no other choice. 

It’s NOT Choice B because this passage has nothing to do with the distribution of work along gender lines, and never mentions gender once. 
It’s NOT Choice C because this quote is more about her returning to her routines because she has no other choice, not necessarily because she has relaxed. It’s close, but not exact. 
It’s NOT Choice D because the major point in this passage is that major change will never happen."
42,C,3,Historical,Science,"Choice A is best. Note that the paragraph referred to in this question is the one starting at line 23, the first two sentences of the passage aren’t counted as a separate paragraph. The author highlights the destruction of ecosystems and the risk of diseases on lines 27-37 (“African savannahs… to cancer”), clearly illustrating those negative repercussions.

It’s NOT Choice B because this paragraph does not detail any specific methods, just that China and the US export their e-waste. 
It’s NOT Choice C because the author has not gotten to any solution at this stage in the passage; they are just outlining the problem.
It’s NOT Choice D because listing countries is not a focus of this paragraph, they are mentioned in passing but the repercussions of dumping are the main focus."
43,B,3,Historical,Science,"Choice B is best. This solution is outlined in lines 38-47 (“It is… to consumers”), where the author states ”it is the responsibility of both the producers and consumers of electronics to ensure that their products are not discarded in dumps like these.” It then goes on to discuss improving waste management infrastructure, fitting in with answer B.

It’s NOT Choice A because the author previously stated that exporting e-waste to other countries was bad, so establishing a system that perpetuates this would not be good for people or the environment. 
It’s NOT Choice C because the author never mentions lessening electronic consumption, and acknowledges that it will keep growing. 
It’s NOT Choice D because again, just transporting e-waste to another country will not solve the problem (according to this author), so creating a market for that will not help reduce waste. "
44,A,2,Historical,Science,"Choice C is best. This sentence essentially restates question 43’s answer. Choice C says “it is the responsibility of both the producers and the consumers of electronics to ensure that their products are not discarded in dumps like these,” while the correct answer in question 43 says “holding producers and consumers responsible for their electronics.”

It’s NOT Choice A because this may justify answer choice A from question 43, but does not mention anything about holding people responsible.
It’s NOT Choice B because this talks about the negative effects of e-waste dumping.
It’s NOT Choice D because this says that the e-waste problem will continue to grow, but does not offer any solutions."
45,D,2,Historical,Science,"Choice B is best. Seep means to flow or leak slowly, which is how we can imagine this toxic sludge moving through Africa’s soil and water. 

It’s NOT Choice A because toxic elements can’t dig.
It’s NOT Choice C because empty implies a more rapid dumping, rather than a slow flow.
It’s NOT Choice D because a leach can be a type of bug, but certainly not in this context."
46,A,2,Historical,Science,"Choice C is best. This refers back to question 43, in which we determined e-waste can be reduced through holding people responsible and creating a disposal infrastructure. The idea of a disposal infrastructure is first brought up in this China example, then is described as first step in combating e-waste in the next paragraph.

It’s NOT Choice A because the recycling program is not a problem of e-waste, but rather a solution. 
It’s NOT Choice B because introducing an example of an e-waste recycling infrastructure is not a question. 
It’s NOT Choice D because this is not really an outcome of the the problem of e-waste dumping, but rather a way to avoid creating that problem."
47,D,3,Historical,Science,"Choice D is best. In lines 101-105 (“To encourage… these programs”) the author suggests a series of governmental measures that are necessary to ensure the success of e-recycling programs.

It’s NOT Choice A because the whole point of this article is to encourage e-waste recycling, not dumping. Also, it doesn’t make sense to combat dumping by combining recycling with dumping. 
It’s NOT Choice B because the author never discusses reducing electronics consumption, and admits that e-waste will be a problem for a long time. 
It’s NOT Choice C because while one of the solutions to encourage more people to recycle their e-waste was to fine non-recyclers or tax electronics, there was no mention of taxing e-waste specifically, and it is certainly not a central claim."
48,C,3,Historical,Science,"Choice B is best. You have to disassemble electronics in order to get access to the valuable materials inside. 

It’s NOT Choice A because destroying the electronics would not allow you to access the materials inside. 
It’s NOT Choice C because they are disassembling the electronics and selling the parts, not recreating the electronics. 
It’s NOT Choice D because interpret means explain the meaning of something, which is not what is going on here."
49,D,3,Historical,Science,"Choice A is best. Passage one does a great job of explaining e-waste and its harmful effects, but is light on specific solutions. In the last two paragraphs of passage 1, the author brings up “holding people responsible” and “creating recycling infrastructure,” but does not get any more specific. Passage two, on the other hand, is very specific about what companies are doing and what governments need to do better. 
 
It’s NOT Choice B because the passages are in agreement that e-waste is a problem that needs to be fixed.
It’s NOT Choice C because there is not much technical language in either of these passages.
It’s NOT Choice D because the two passages agree on the problem; it’s just that passage two offers more specific solutions to it."
50,C,4,Historical,Science,"Choice B is best. Passage two makes it clear that two things are needed to reduce e-waste: improved recycling plants and government incentives for recycling. In this example from passage one, China introduced the government incentives. So, the author of passage two would say they are still missing half of the solution, with the other half being improved plants.

It’s NOT Choice A because passage two never mentions special provisions for toxic waste; it just talks about e-waste in general. 
It’s NOT Choice C because neither passage discusses the amount of government regulation the Chinese are used to. 
It’s NOT Choice D because while passage two does factor in profitability, that isn’t a main concern in the need for e-waste recycling."
51,C,2,Historical,Science,"Choice B is best. According to passage two, there are two things needed to reduce e-waste: improved recycling plants and government incentives for recycling. This paragraph clearly states the first, which relates back to question 50, especially the line “these improved recycling programs offer a significant step forward in solving the e-waste problem.”

It’s NOT Choice A because this just describes how these plants work; it does not relate at all to China’s plan.
It’s NOT Choice C because this justifies the second need for reducing e-waste, which is government incentives for recycling. China had this, but was missing the improved plants.
It’s NOT Choice D because this also justifies the need for government incentives, and is incorrect for the same reason as choice C. "
52,A,2,Historical,Science,"Choice C is best. Explicit means stated outright. In passage one, we have “this practice harms the countries’ environments and citizens,” which kicks off a detailed look into e-waste’s effect on the environment and disease spread. Implicit means implied but not clearly expressed. Passage two hints around that e-waste is dangerous, but never states that it is specifically bad for the environment and people. 

It’s NOT Choice A because both of these passages are calling attention to the problem of e-waste, presumably because people don’t realize how dangerous it is.
It’s NOT Choice B because this specific claim was never made, and, in fact, passage two says that even after recycling, e-waste needs to be disposed of safely.
It’s NOT Choice D because although this is discussed briefly in passage one, passage two never mentions jobs for local peoples or the secondary market."
