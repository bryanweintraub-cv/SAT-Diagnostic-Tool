Choice D is correct. First let’s extract the relevant information from this word problem:
<ul>
 <li> passes in leather seats are $85 each </li>
 <li> passes for hard plastic seats are $50 each</li>
 <li> 475 total passes were sold </li>
 <li> $23,500 had been raised through pass sales </li>
</ul>
So if we say that S leather seats were sold and H hard seats were sold, we can make two equations — one where adding H and S together yields the total number of chairs, and one where adding H and S multiplied by their respective costs (85 for S and 50 for H) yields $23,500.
This leaves us with the equations \(85S+50H = 23,500\) and \(S+H=475\), which is D
