Choice D is correct.
This question looks more scary than it is.
Since you are given the maximum volume the tank can hold, you just plug that into the given volume equation and solve for p.
</br>
First take \(355=\frac{5 \pi p^3}{27}\) and rearrange to isolate p, giving you \(\frac{355 \times 27}5 \i{} = p^3\)
</br>
From here take the cube root to find p, giving you \(\sqrt[3]{\frac{355 \times 27}{5 \pi}}=p=8.48\), which is D.

<i>Note: many students get confused by the apparent complexity of problems 9-11, this is a good place to encourage students to make sure they take in all information in a word problem/diagram, and then develop the skill of focusing on only the information that is relevant to finding the answer
