0 is correct. The side lengths are not relevant in this problem, what is necessary is that you know that ∠ABC is a 90 degree angle, and that it would be split by line segment BE.
A possible way that this would look is illustrated below, but E could be anywhere along line segment AC:

</br>
Here it is clear that \(∠CBE\) is equal to \(90-∠ABE\), therefore we can rewrite \(sin(∠ABE)-cos(∠CBE)\) as   \(sin(∠ABE)-cos(90-∠ABE)\).
</br></br>
Using our trig identities, we know that \(sin(x)=cos(90-x)\), therefore we can rewrite \(cos(90-∠ABE)\) as \(sin(∠ABE)\)
</br></br>
Rewriting the equation, we are left with \(sin(∠ABE)-sin(∠ABE)=0\), giving our answer.
