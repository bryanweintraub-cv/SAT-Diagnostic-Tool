Choice A is correct. This question is asking for you to calculate the slope from the data set and then come up with an equation (which will end up in slope-intercept form) that describes the change in class size over the years.
</br>
</br>
First we calculate the slope using \(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{727-753}{2016-2006}=frac{-26}{10}=-2.6\)
</br>
</br>
Then we plug into slope intercept form, with the y-intercept equal to the 2006 value (year 0). This gives us \(S(y)=-2.6y+753\).
</br>
</br>
This does not exactly match any of the answers, but by rearranging the addition in the right side of the equation we are left with \(S(y)=753-2.6y\), which is A
</br>
</br>
<i> Note: “y” in the final equation just stands for year, it is actually the independent variable (x-axis variable).
This is different from the y-value in \(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\), which was referring to the two dependent variables.</i>
