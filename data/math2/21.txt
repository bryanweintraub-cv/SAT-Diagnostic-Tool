Choice C is correct.
We know that 1.93 is the slope of the line of best fit.
Since slope is equivalent to rise over run \((m=\frac{rise}{run})\) we can describe slope as being the average increase in the amount of wheat (in millions of tons) per year \((m=\frac{\text{Amount of wheat}}{\text{number of years}})\).
We should look for the answer that most closely matches what weâ€™ve said, which is C.

<i>Note: some students mistakenly answer D for this question, but D would actually be the average y value if you took all y values across this line segment. The important thing is to focus on slope being an increase/decrease from year to year.
