696 is correct.
For this question we will use the data available in the chart.
Since we know that at 4 minutes there are 54 grams of salt per liter of water, we can multiply 15 liters of water by 54 grams to obtain \(15L*54g/L=810g\) at 4 minutes.
</br></br>
We also know from the chart that there are 19 grams per liter of salt at 8 minutes.
We multiply this by 6 liters to get \(6L*19g/L=114g\).
</br></br>
Now we take the difference between these two values to get our answer, \(810g-114g=696g\)
