Choice D is correct.
Since \(density = \frac{mass}{volume}\), we need to rearrange this equation to solve for mass.
Multiply both sides by volume, and you have \(density \times volume=mass\).
</br>
Plug in your density value of 3.6 ounces per cubic inch, and then we need to solve for volume by multiplying length width and height.
This gives us the equation \((3.6)(50\times20\times30)=mass=108,000\), which is D
