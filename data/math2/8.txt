Choice B is correct.
Because the answer is asking about the value of x+2 instead of the value of x in these equations, visually it can be easier to rewrite the equation as \(y=\frac{3}{y}\) (with \(y=x+2\)).
In this form it becomes clear that the answer must be \(\sqrt{3}\).
A way to visualize this is by rewriting the 3 in the numerator as \(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}\),
leaving you with \(\sqrt{3}=\frac{\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}\), cancel the \(\sqrt{3}\) in the numerator and denominator and you are left with the answer, B.
