Choice B is correct.
Since we know that y is equal to the number of years and f is equal to the number of half years, and we know that there are two half years for every year, we can write this out as \(f=2y\).
Solve for y here, and then plug in the answer for y to get your new rate equation.

\(\frac{f}{2}=y\), therefore \(R=1500(1.03)^\frac{f}{2}\)is the same as \(R=1500(1.03)^y\)
