Choice B is correct.
Because lines d and e are parallel, the two triangles created by these lines intersecting angle \(a°\) contain equivalent angles.
Since the sum of all angles in a triangle is equal to 180°, \(a+b+c=180\).
Since we are given the values for \(b°\) and \(c°\), we plug in and solve for \(a°\), giving us \(a+30+40=180\) therefore \(a=180-70=110\), B.
