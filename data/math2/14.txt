Choice D is correct. A fraction is undefined when its denominator equals zero, therefore this question is asking for us to find a y value where \(y^2+2y-15=0\)
</br>
First we factor the polynomial out, leaving us with \((y+5)(y-3)=0\). This means that the denominator equals zero when \(y = -5\) and when \(y = 3\).
</br>
Looking through our possible answers, of -5 and 3 only 3 is given. Therefore, the answer is D
