0.6 is correct. We can determine the value of p by plugging in one of the answers from the chart into our equation. Iâ€™ll choose 4 and 54.
</br></br>
Plugging these values in, we end up with \(54=150p^{4/2} \)
</br></br>
Now dividing both sides by 150 will leave us with \(p^2=\frac{54}{150}=0.36\)
</br></br>
Take the square root of both sides \(\sqrt{p^2}=\sqrt{0.36}=0.6\), therefore \(0.6=p\)
