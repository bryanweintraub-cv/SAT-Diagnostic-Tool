Choice C is correct. Using exponent rules we know that a negative exponent gives the inverse and a fractional exponent gives the root of the base term. Therefore we can rewrite \(c^\frac{-1}{3}\) as \( \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{c}}\).
</br>
Now we solve for c in  \( \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{c}} = y\), rearrange by multiplying the denominator over and dividing by y, leaving you with \( \frac{1}{y}=\sqrt[3]{c} \)
<br>
Next, cube both sides to remove the cube root sign from c, leaving you with \(\frac{1}{y^3}=c\)
